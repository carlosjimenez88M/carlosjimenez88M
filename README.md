## 🐎 Workhorse

For at least a year, to optimize my work as a Machine Learning DevOps Engineer and streamline my activities, I adopted the strategy of working with a Raspberry Pi connected to my iPad, and honestly, I love it!

## 👨🏻‍💼 Conferences  Talks


For a long time, my work focused on the statistical side, and therefore you will find many talks focused on R. Recently, I have been speaking a lot about Machine Learning focused on DevOps or AI applied to different disciplines, with these recent talks developed in Python. You can find an organized list of all these topics at the following link. <https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/talks>
