## 👨🏻‍💼 Conferences  Talks


For a long time, my work focused on the statistical side, and therefore you will find many talks focused on R. Recently, I have been speaking a lot about Machine Learning focused on DevOps or AI applied to different disciplines, with these recent talks developed in Python. You can find an organized list of all these topics at the following link. <https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/talks>
