## 👨🏻‍💻 About me :


I work at the intersection of AI and MLOps, focusing my efforts on scalability, performance, and efficiency, in both Language Models (LLMs) and Classical Machine Learning. My research centers on Edge Computing, as well as statistical modeling applied to Machine Learning, and to a lesser extent, the acceleration of training and workflows using GPUs

## 👨🏻‍💼 Conferences & Talks


For a long time, my work focused on the statistical side, and therefore you will find many talks focused on R. Recently, I have been speaking a lot about Machine Learning focused on DevOps or AI applied to different disciplines, with these recent talks developed in Python. You can find an organized list of all these topics at the following link. <https://github.com/carlosjimenez88M/talks>
